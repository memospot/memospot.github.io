:::tip[Safety]{icon="seti:lock"}
  Should you get any warnings about the app being unsafe, don’t worry.

  Memospot was not signed with a digital signing certificate, as it costs a considerable amount of money yearly, and this app does not generate any revenue.

  Feel free to scan the executable with known tools such as [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com) or
  [Jotti's Malware scanner](https://virusscan.jotti.org).

  Note that some tools may flag [Tauri](https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1142423001002954854)
  apps regardless, but you should get a low score, if any.
