Memospot behavior can be configured via `memospot.yaml`.

## File location

## Sample configuration file

Fields that default to `null` are detected at runtime.

```yaml
memos:
  # Memos data storage. Where the database and assets are stored.
  #
  # This setting allows you to change the data storage (database,
  # assets, and thumbnails) to a folder synced by a cloud storage
  # provider client, like OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.
  data: null

  # Use this to spawn a custom Memos binary.
  binary_path: null

  # Memos working directory. This is where the `dist` folder
  # must reside (from v0.18.2 to v0.21.0).

  # Mode: [prod] | dev | demo. This changes the database file in use.
  mode: prod

  # Address where Memos will listen for connections.
  # Listening to 127.0.0.1 won't trigger Windows Firewall, and the
  # server instance will only be accessible from the host computer.
  # This is the default.
  #
  # Listening to 0.0.0.0 will make the server available
  # at all your computer's network adapters addresses
  # if it's allowed by the Firewall.
  addr: 127.0.0.1

  # Memos' port. Managed by Memospot. You can set a custom port,
