## White screen or plain-text error

If you encounter an error while the Memos page is loading, or if it remains blank, press F5 or right-click the window and select 'Reload'.

This is caused by a stale WebView cache and also affects Memos' Docker
instances. It's more likely to happen right after an update.

## Linux-specific

If Memospot starts but doesn't get past the loading screen, or the screen remains white, you may be experiencing an issue with hardware acceleration in your GPU driver. This is a common issue with Linux virtual machines.

Try running Memospot with the WebView acceleration disabled with the following
command:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 memospot
```

If it solves your problem, you can disable the WebView acceleration permanently
via [Configuration](/guides/configuration#sample-configuration-file) (see `memospot.env.vars`).

## Updater issues

The easiest way to solve update issues is to download the latest release from the releases page and install it over your current version.

If the auto-updater isn't working for your setup and the notifications are annoying, you can delay checks or disable it in [Configuration](/guides/configuration#sample-configuration-file) (see `memospot.updater`).

## Manual Memos update issues

If the updater fails to replace `memos`:

1. Terminate `memos` and `memospot` processes.
2. Retry the update.
