## Memos

### White screen or plain-text error

If you encounter an error while the Memos page is loading, or if it remains blank,
press F5 or right-click the window and select 'Reload'.

This is caused by a stale WebView cache and also affects Memos' Docker
instances. It's more likely to happen right after an update.

## Updates

### Updater errors

The easiest way to solve update issues is to download the latest release from the releases page and install it over your current version.

If the auto-updater isn't working for your setup and the notifications are annoying, you can delay checks or disable the updater entirely in [Configuration](/guides/configuration#sample-configuration-file) (see `memospot.updater`).

### Memos server update issues

If the updater fails to replace `memos`:

<Steps>
  1. Terminate `memos` and `memospot` processes:
      <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="Windows">
          ```powershell
          [System.Diagnostics.Process]::GetProcesses() | Where-Object {
            $_.ProcessName -in "memospot", "memos"
          } | Stop-Process -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
          ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Linux/macOS">
          ```bash
          killall memospot memos
          ```
        </TabItem>
      </Tabs>
  2. Retry the update.
</Steps>

## Linux-specific

For general Linux troubleshooting, run the app in the terminal to see any error messages:

```bash
memospot
```

:::caution[Heuristic environment variables]{icon="linux"}
  Memospot automatically tries to detect the best settings for your system. You can check current environment variables by enabling and inspecting the [log file](/guides/debugging/#enabling-logging).

  You can unset any internal environment variables by defining them again with an empty value, like `FLAG=` (configuration screen) or `FLAG: ""` ([memospot.yaml](/guides/configuration/)).

:::tip[Making flags permanent]{icon="linux"}
  If one of the following flags resolves your issue, set it in [`memospot.env.vars`](/guides/configuration#sample-configuration-file).

### White screen or hanging on loading

If you encounter this issue, it may be due to a problem with hardware acceleration in your GPU driver. This is a common issue with Linux virtual machines.

Run the app with the WebView acceleration disabled:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 memospot
```

### Sluggish scrolling or typing with NVIDIA GPUs

Run the app with explicit synchronization disabled:

```bash
__NV_DISABLE_EXPLICIT_SYNC=1 memospot
```

### EGL display-related errors

Run the app forcing the X11 backend:

```bash
GDK_BACKEND=x11 memospot
```

### Other graphical issues

Run the app disabling the DMABUF renderer:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 memospot
```

### GLIBC errors

You'll have to upgrade your distribution.
