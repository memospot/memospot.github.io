title: Updating Memos
description: A guide to updating Memos in Memospot.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

In general, you should download and install new versions of Memospot when they
are [released](https://github.com/memospot/memospot/releases). They come bundled with the latest tested Memos server version, being the easiest and safest way to update.

:::tip
  An auto-updater was introduced in Memospot v0.1.7,
  but your mileage may vary depending on your platform and bundle.
:::

## Standalone update

While a standalone server update works in most cases, manual updates are
strongly discouraged for anything other than a **Patch** version release.

:::note[Memos version scheme]
  The semantic version scheme used by Memos is `Major.Minor.Patch`.
:::

:::caution
  Standalone updates can break things due to database and API changes
  that occur between Major and Minor versions, which Memospot may not yet be prepared to handle.

  If the worst happens, you won't be able to revert the server binary to a previous working
  version without also reverting to a database backup matching the server version.
:::

## Script-aided procedure

For convenience, there are server updater scripts with auto-backup
capabilities.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    Open PowerShell and run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; & ([ScriptBlock]::Create((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memospot/memospot/main/memos-server-updater.ps1')))
    ```

    You can check the script source [here.](https://github.com/memospot/memospot/blob/main/memos-server-updater.ps1)

    :::tip[Install a specific version]
      The script can take an optional argument to specify a tag to update to.

      E.g. `[…]memos-server-updater.ps1'))) "v0.25.2"`
    :::

    :::note
      You must run PowerShell as Admin if you are using Memospot `MSI` installers,
      as they do a system-wide installation.

      This is **not** necessary when using the NSIS/exe installer,
      as it only installs the application for the current user.
    :::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux/macOS">
    Open a terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memospot/memospot/main/memos-server-updater.sh | sudo bash
    ```

    You can check the script source [here.](https://github.com/memospot/memospot/blob/main/memos-server-updater.sh)

    :::tip[Install a specific version]
      The script can take an optional argument to specify a tag to update to.

      E.g. `[…]memos-server-updater.sh | sudo bash -s v0.25.2`
    :::

    On Linux, you must run the script with `sudo`, as the Memospot package installs Memos to `/usr/bin/`.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Manual procedure

The basic server update process is to download the latest Memos release from
the [memos-builds](https://github.com/memospot/memos-builds/releases) repository and
replace the `memos` binary in the installation folder.

:::danger
  Do not proceed without taking a backup of your database.

  Close Memospot, copy the `memos` server binary and the `memos_prod.db`
  database file(s) to a location outside your working scope for extra safety.

    :::tip
      Remember to `chmod +x` the `memos` binary after replacing it.

### From Memos v0.18.2 to v0.21.0

:::note
  This only applies to this version range, where the web front end wasn't
  embedded in the server binary.
:::

The downloaded build contains a `dist` folder (the web front end). You must
place it in the appropriate folder:

  <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```batch
    %LocalAppData%\Memospot
    ```
    ```powershell
    $Env:LocalAppData\Memospot
    ```

  <TabItem label="macOS">
    ```bash
    $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/com.memospot.app/
    ```
  </TabItem>
