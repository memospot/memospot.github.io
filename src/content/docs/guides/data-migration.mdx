description: A guide to data migration between Memos and Memospot.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

:::tip[Portable data]
The current version of Memos stores assets in a portable format.

All data can be seamlessly moved between Memos containers and Memospot instances, regardless of the operating system.
:::

> Assets, attachments, resources, and objects are interchangeable terms that refer to the same thing: uploaded files.

## Data storage location

:::note[Relevant files]

- `memos_prod.db`
- `memos_prod.db-shm` (may not exist)
- `memos_prod.db-wal` (may not exist)
- `assets` directory

:::

The `.thumbnail_cache` directory and its contents are generated as needed. You may skip it
when migrating data.

If you haven't found your data on the predefined directories, check your [configuration](/guides/configuration#sample-configuration-file) (see `memos.data`).

### Memos server

        ```
        :::tip
        If you are using a custom `docker-compose.yml` file, check if your data is in the same directory as it.

        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Basic data migration

- Close Memospot and/or stop the Memos Docker container
- Copy your `assets` folder from source to the destination data directory
- Copy `memos_prod.db` (with the sidecar journal files, if they exist) to the destination data directory

:::note[Journal files]
Always copy existing journal files (`memos_prod.db-shm` and `memos_prod.db-wal`)
along with the database file.

They may contain recent data that has not been committed to the database yet.

Note that these files won't exist if the database was closed properly.

:::

## Migrating data from earlier Memos versions

:::caution
None of the following is needed if you have never stored assets outside the database (default behavior) or
if you have used Memospot v0.1.3+ in the past since it contains a
built-in database migrator.

If that's the case, all your data is already portable.
:::

## Brief history

- Up to Memos v0.18.1, databases and assets were not portable. They pointed to
  absolute paths at the host's file system, and moving data between systems required
  the instructions written on this page.
- Memos v0.18.2 started saving new assets with relative paths, but shipped a
  very slow path migrator for pre-existing assets.
- The asset path migrator was removed from Memos v0.19.1+.
- Memospot v0.1.3/v0.1.4 (bundled with Memos v0.20.0, compatible up to v0.21.0)
  shipped with its own fast asset migrator.

:::tip
If you are coming from an old Memos version,
consider installing [Memospot v1.0.2](https://github.com/memospot/memospot/releases/tag/v1.0.2).
It will fix all asset paths in the database automatically on the first start.

This versions also contains the last Memos server version (v0.25.2) that can upgrade very old database schemas.
:::

## Legacy instructions (before v0.18.2)

This guide will help you migrate your Memos database and assets to a new host.

It's possible to migrate between Windows and POSIX hosts, and between Memos
Docker and Memospot, in any combination or direction. Just follow the
appropriate steps.

If you only used the default `Database` object storage, you can skip the assets
migration part and just copy the database files to the new host.

:::note
MySQL and PostgreSQL are not supported by Memospot, so this guide will only
cover SQLite migrations.

Check Memos'
[database documentation](https://usememos.com/docs/configuration/database)
if you need to work with other drivers.

:::

:::danger
Do not proceed without taking an offline backup of your database.

Stop the server and copy the database files and assets to a location
outside your working scope for extra safety.
:::

### Requirements

- A SQLite3 client, like
  [DB Browser for SQLite](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser)

- SSH access to your Docker host, if applicable

- An SCP/SFTP client, like [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) and
  [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io): to copy files to/from host, if needed

### Basic migration

- Close Memospot and stop your Docker container
- Copy your assets folder from source to destination host
- Copy `memos_prod.db` (and sidecar files `memos_prod.db-shm` and
  `memos_prod.db-wal`, if they exist) to a work directory on your local machine
- Open the copied `memos_prod.db` with your SQLite client
- Execute the [appropriate SQL queries](#replacing-assets-paths-in-the-database)
- Write the changes to the database and close it
- Copy the modified `memos_prod.db` file to the destination

:::tip
The default Memos data path on a Docker _**host**_ is `~/.memos/`.

Within the _**container**_, the path is `/var/opt/memos`.

Unless you changed it, `~/.memos/` is where you'll find your assets and
database.

:::

### Replacing assets paths in the database

The following queries assume the following:

- You are using the default internal Docker volume path `/var/opt/memos`

- All your relative paths are using the default `assets` folder

:::caution
Pay attention to the leading and trailing slashes when editing the queries
below.

:::

:::danger
Remember to always back up your database before running SQL queries.
:::

The following sections contains queries to replace the assets paths in the
database.

Pick one path style:

#### Using absolute paths (Memos v0.18.0)

:::danger
There are some `__PLACEHOLDERS__` in the following queries that you must
replace with resolved absolute paths from your system, as SQL clients won't
resolve system environment variables.

        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::caution
When migrating data **to** a Memos Docker container, you must specify the
_internal_ Docker volume path, which is `/var/opt/memos`.

The host-accessible data path is set later (`~/.memos/` in the example), when you launch the container:

```bash
docker run -d \
 --init \
 --name memos \
 --publish 5230:5230 \
 --volume ~/.memos/:/var/opt/memos \
 ghcr.io/usememos/memos:latest
```

Choose what best suits your migration scenario, then copy and **adjust** the SQL query:

        -- Replace remaining Windows path separators

#### Using relative paths (Memos >= v0.18.1)

These queries will replace absolute paths with relative paths.

:::caution[Compatibility]
While this method works fine and is simpler (queries work as shown), it will mix path styles
in your database if you keep running versions older than v0.18.2, as new assets will be created
with absolute paths.

:::

:::danger[Constraints]

- This only works if you have the default prefix `assets` in all your paths.

- Assets with relative paths will be resolved relatively to the `MEMOS_DATA`
  environment variable.

                                            INSTR(internal_path, '/assets')

### After migration

:::tip[Sanity check]
Remember to browse the `resource` table and check if the new values in the
`internal_path` column are adequate to the destination host filesystem.

:::

Execute the following query to check the first 100 rows:

```sql
SELECT type, filename, internal_path
  FROM resource WHERE internal_path IS NOT '' LIMIT 100;
```
